# 1. flipkart web scrapping code.ipynb

This file contains the python code for scrapping data from the flipkart website. It scrapes features of the laptop like names, processor,
ram, os, storage, dimensions, warranty, prices, ratings. 
This code uses the html class names which might get changed in future if the website is updated. So make sure to check the
class name and change it with the new class name.

# 2. Dataset.csv

This is the csv file which contains the dataset which I scrapped from the flipkart website. It scrapped all the features which I mentioned above.

# 3. Prediction Code.ipynb

This is the code for prediction model. In this I have done some data cleaning and data analysis and dropped some irrelevant features like 'Ratings' and 'OS'.
Then I have applied  "RandomForest" machine learning algoritm to build the prediction model.
